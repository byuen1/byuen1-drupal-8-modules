This repository is for modules that I've created for the projects that I am on that may be of use to the Drupal community.

Modules I've created:

  block_revision_log: This module adds a revision log to the block_content entity. I am currently making this for stakeholders. It works on vanilla Drupal and will be implemented soon on the client's website.

  media_revision_log: This module adds a revision log to the media entity. I made this for stakeholders that wanted to view the revision       log messages of media that their organisation impacts.
